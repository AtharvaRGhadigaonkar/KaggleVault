A curated collection of my Kaggle notebooks spanning competitions, datasets, and experiments. This vault serves as a personal archive and a shared resource for learning and exploring data science techniques.

## 📘 Contents

- 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- 🤖 Machine Learning Models
- 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- 🧠 Feature Engineering
- 🏆 Competition Submissions

## 📁 Structure

Each directory is named after a Kaggle competition or dataset and typically contains:
- A main `.ipynb` notebook
- Supporting files (if needed)
- Optional `README.md` with details on the approach
